    """
    Neural Hyperlink Predictor (NHP) for undirected hyperedge link prediction.
    - Proposed in `NHP: Neural Hypergraph Link Prediction <https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3340531.3411870>`_ paper (CIKM 2020).
    - Reference implementation: `source <https://github.com/cyixiao/NHP-reproduce/>`_.

    NHP scores each candidate hyperedge by building candidate-specific node embeddings.
    A node that appears in multiple candidate hyperedges can receive a different incidence embedding in each one,
    because its update depends on the other nodes in that candidate hyperedge.

    Example:
        >>> x = [
        ...     [1., 0.],  # node 0
        ...     [0., 1.],  # node 1
        ...     [1., 1.],  # node 2
        ...     [1., 0.],  # node 3
        ... ]
        >>> hyperedge_index = [
        ...     [0, 1, 1, 2, 3],  # node IDs
        ...     [0, 0, 1, 1, 1],  # hyperedge IDs
        ... ]
        >>> # hyperedge 0 = {node 0, node 1}
        >>> # hyperedge 1 = {node 1, node 2, node 3}
        >>> model = NHP(in_channels=2, hidden_channels=8, aggregation="maxmin")
        >>> scores = model(x, hyperedge_index)
        >>> scores.shape
        ... torch.Size([2])
