# Installation


## Install with uv

For users working with the pip package manager, hyperbench can be installed from PyPI.

```bash
pip install hyperbench
# if you want to install optional dependencies for tensorboard support:
pip install "hyperbench[tensorboard]"
```

Additionally, it is recommended to install and run hyperbench from a virtual environment, for example, using the Python standard library’s venv.
Internally, we use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) as a build and development tool, which also provides a convenient way to manage virtual environments and dependencies.
After installing uv, you can set up the environment and install hyperbench with:

```bash
uv init
uv add hyperbench # or uv pip install hyperbench
# for optional dependencies:
uv add "hyperbench[tensorboard]"
```

## Python version support

See Python support policy in [Policies](../development/policies.md#python-support).

## Install from source

Use the development installation for contributing or if you want to use the latest features that haven't been released yet. See the [Development guide](../development/development.md) for instructions on setting up a development environment.
