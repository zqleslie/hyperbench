## About the project

HyperBench is a PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning library for hypergraph learning and benchmarking. It provides a standardized workflow for loading hypergraph datasets, training models, evaluating them under comparable settings, and reporting results. The current release focuses on Hyperlink Prediction, with ready-to-run pipelines for established hypergraph baselines.

The library is built around extensibility: datasets are represented in [HIF](https://github.com/HIF-org/HIF-standard) format and converted into typed tensor objects, models can be implemented as standard Lightning modules, and benchmarking is handled through reusable trainers, samplers, metrics, loggers, and result exporters (Markdown/LaTeX). HyperBench includes preloaded datasets, mini-batch and full-hypergraph data loading, negative sampling utilities, structural feature enrichers, neural components, and built-in models such as HGNN, HNHN, HyperGCN, GCN, MLP/SLP, NHP, Node2Vec, VilLain, and more.

Use HyperBench to:
- Benchmark existing models across a shared collection of hypergraph datasets.
- Develop custom PyTorch or PyTorch Lightning models and train and compare them against the built-in baselines.
- Integrate new datasets through the HIF format and run the same training, evaluation, and reporting pipeline on them.

## Getting started

For users working with the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager, hyperbench can be installed from PyPI.

```bash
pip install hyperbench
# if you want to install optional dependencies for tensorboard support:
pip install "hyperbench[tensorboard]"
```

or alternatively, using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv add hyperbench # or uv pip install hyperbench
# for optional dependencies:
uv add "hyperbench[tensorboard]"
```

If you want to build the project from source, see the [documentation](#documentation) for more details.

### Run examples

You can download [examples](examples) directory and run the example scripts to get started. For instance:

```bash
python3 examples/early_stopping.py
```
or with `uv`:

```bash
uv run examples/early_stopping.py
```

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on contributing to the project.

## Documentation

You can find the extensive documentation [here][docs].
Alternatively, you can build the documentation locally with the following commands:

```bash
make docs
# or with explicit commands:
uv run zensical build --clean -f zensical.toml
uv run zensical serve -f zensical.toml -a 127.0.0.1:8000
```
and open the browser at http://localhost:8000 to access the documentation.
